# AI Lab Projects

A collection of artificial intelligence implementations covering logic programming, search algorithms, and machine learning.

## Projects

### 1. University Course System (Prolog)
**File:** `Assignment_1_KB.pl`

A knowledge-based system that manages university courses, prerequisites, and student progress tracking using Prolog logic programming.

### 2. A* Pathfinding Algorithm (Python)
**File:** `Assignment_2_A_Star.py`

Implementation of the A* search algorithm to find optimal routes between locations in Dhaka city using heuristic search.

### 3. Penguin Species Classification (Jupyter)
**File:** `Assignment_3_ML_Project.ipynb`

Machine learning project that classifies penguin species using logistic regression on the Palmer Penguins dataset with 100% accuracy.

## Technologies

- **Prolog** - Logic programming
- **Python** - Core implementation
- **Jupyter** - Interactive notebooks
- **scikit-learn** - Machine learning

## Usage

Run the Prolog file in SWI-Prolog, execute the Python script directly, or open the Jupyter notebook in any compatible environment.
